# Ceres
A Terra terrain config pack built from the Default Pack. 
> Note: Ceres is still in very early development. It is not recommended to be used in production yet. 
## Credits
Default Pack: dfsek 
Carving: Astrash
Mr.Wizz88: Oak and Pine tree assets.

## Platforms
This pack is currently developed on and **for Bukkit platforms**. In future I hope to have a seperate branch for a fabric pack that better utilizes Terra's capabilities. 

## Features
In it's current state, Ceres works with an extra tall world (-512 - 256+). This is because of extra mining features added to underground areas. It's likely that this height will change in future, and a pack for standard world height will be created. 

Ceres currently doesn't differ much from the default pack (hence why I havent submitted it to the main terra packs page <.<). It includes a couple extra biomes (Hill variants of bamboo forests, birch forests, and dark oak forests), some custom trees (Oak, Pine, Spruce, and birch.), custom villages (Plains, desert, fantasy, spruce, and campsites.) and improved mountains.

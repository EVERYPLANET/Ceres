# Ceres
A Terra terrain config pack built from the Default Pack. 
> Note: Ceres is still in very early development. It is not recommended to be used in production yet. 
## Credits
Default Pack: dfsek 

Carving: Astrash

Mr.Wizz88: Oak and Pine tree assets.

## Platforms
This pack is currently developed on and **for Bukkit platforms**. Only support minecraft version is 1.17 and most likely will not support older versions. In future I hope to have a seperate branch for a fabric pack that better utilizes Terra's capabilities. 

## Pack Options
There are currently two packs (large and normal). The large pack runs from -512 to 512 and will contain extra underground features, this pack will not work in normal height worlds. The normal pack runs in a standard 1.17 world height and will not contains extra underground features due to space limitations.

You can download the height datapack for the large pack here: [large_height.zip](https://github.com/EVERYPLANET/Ceres/files/6751143/1024.height.zip)

> The large pack contains extremely unfinished underground features right now. The normal pack is edited from the large pack, so if running it on a normal sized worlds you may experience out of range crashes sometimes. This will be fixed soon.

## Features
In it's current state, Ceres Large works with an extra tall world (-512 - 256+). This is because of extra mining features added to underground areas. It's likely that this height will change in future, and a pack for standard world height will be created. 

Ceres currently doesn't differ much from the default pack (hence why I havent submitted it to the main terra packs page <.<). It includes a couple extra biomes (Hill variants of bamboo forests, birch forests, and dark oak forests), some custom trees (Oak, Pine, Spruce, and birch.), custom villages (Plains, desert, fantasy, spruce, and campsites.) and improved mountains.
